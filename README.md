# Pong Clone

## Clone of Pong game using Python with Turtle

This is my first app built using Python with the Turtle module.

```git clone git@github.com:Codeherder19/pong-clone.git```

```cd pong-clone```

```python Pong1.py```

Player B's controls - Pressing "O" will move the paddle up, and "L" moves the paddle down.
